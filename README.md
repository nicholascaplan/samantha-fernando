# Samantha Fernando Website

Static multi-page portfolio for composer Samantha Fernando. Biography, Works & Media, Listen, Watch, Writing, Contact and Privacy have directly loadable HTML pages. Writing shows the complete Wintering essay directly.

## Technical Overview

- Shared HTML/CSS/JavaScript source and committed content fallbacks in `index.html`; `scripts/lib/pages.mjs` generates distinct pages and a shared `assets/site.js` runtime into `_site/`.
- Ordinary navigation links are progressively enhanced to preserve audio controllers while replacing page content and metadata. Full loads work without the enhancement; reloading resets playback.
- Page-specific titles, descriptions, canonical/social metadata and structured data, plus a sitemap generated from the canonical route registry. The Works catalogue is pre-rendered using `assets/catalogue-renderer.js`, shared with browser filtering.
- Compiled Tailwind CSS in `assets/tailwind.min.css`; Font Awesome and Google Fonts loaded from CDNs.
- SoundCloud Widget API for verified SoundCloud recordings.
- Spotify track playback through the Spotify IFrame API.
- A unified Works & Media catalogue. The committed fallback contains 23 works, thirteen recordings and eleven films; Sanity can add or remove entries.
- YouTube videos open in an in-page modal from thumbnail cards.
- GitHub Pages deployment from the `main` branch.

## Content (Sanity)

Biography and the Works & Media catalogue have Sanity schemas (`studio/`, project `9a66iw1t`) and build-time integration. Both are editable at <https://samantha-fernando.sanity.studio>. Published content is baked into the static pages, never fetched from Sanity in the browser.

```bash
npm run build:content        # writes the publishable site to _site/ using live Sanity content
cd studio && npm run dev     # run the Studio locally
cd studio && npm run deploy  # publish the hosted Studio after schema changes
```

If Sanity is unavailable or incomplete, `build:content` keeps the committed section fallback in `index.html`. Biography and Works & Media fall back independently. `studio/scripts/seed-biography.ts` recreates Biography; `studio/scripts/seed-catalogue.ts` imports the catalogue without overwriting existing editor changes. See `docs/sanity.md` before running either import.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm run build:css
npm run build:test     # deterministic committed content; use build:content for published Sanity content
npm run serve
```

Open <http://localhost:8000>. Serve `_site/`, not the repository root or `file://`. Rebuild after source changes. Generated pages live at `/`, `/biography/`, `/works/`, `/listen/`, `/watch/`, `/writing/`, `/contact/` and `/privacy/`. The retired `/works/#listen` and `/works/#watch` views redirect to the new pages; old root-fragment bookmarks are not mapped.

## Tests

Install dependencies and Chromium once with `npm install` and `npx playwright install chromium`, then run `npm test`. Playwright builds deterministic pages and serves `_site/` on port 8010 without reusing an existing server. Use `npm run test:unit` for build/renderer checks and `npm run test:all` for the full browser matrix. `playwright.built.config.js` tests an already-built artifact without replacing its content.

PR checks run unit tests and all four Playwright projects (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit and mobile Chromium). Install all desktop browser engines locally with `npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit` to run the full matrix. See [the test strategy](docs/test-strategy.md#pull-requests) for the required merge checks and branch-protection setup.

## Deployment

- Hosting, DNS precautions, deployment verification and recovery: [hosting guide](docs/hosting.md).
- Production domain: <https://www.samanthafernando.com/>
- The Pages workflow runs on pushes to `main`, Sanity publish webhooks, manual dispatch and daily at 8am UK time (`Europe/London`, following GMT/BST). See `docs/sanity.md` for scheduling limitations.
